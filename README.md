Project Description
Student Bazaar is a marketplace platform specifically designed for university and college students to buy, sell, or auction student-related goods such as textbooks, school supplies, and other resources. It aims to streamline peer-to-peer transactions by providing easy listing options, messaging tools, and faculty supervision to ensure secure and ethical exchanges.

The project was created to address the need for a student-focused marketplace that offers more transparency, affordability, and accessibility compared to existing platforms. By leveraging unique features like stock notifications, availability reports, and analytics, Student Bazaar empowers students to save money, connect with peers, and reduce waste.

- Messaging System: Communicate privately with buyers and sellers within the platform.
Faculty Supervision: Faculty members can monitor listings, flag suspicious content, and maintain marketplace integrity.
